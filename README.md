# Array Manipulation Tasks

## First Task: Modifying Array Elements

Creating a function named `transformArray` that takes an array of numbers as input is the task assigned to this assignment. Every element of the array goes through several changes inside this function:

- The element is squared if it is even.
- The element is tripled if it is unusual.

After that, the function outputs a new array with the values that have been altered.

## Task 2: Editing Strings and Comparing Arrays

To accomplish this goal, we are defining a method called `compareArrays` that accepts two arrays as parameters: a string-only array and a number-only array. The following steps are carried out by the function:

1. It determines if the lengths of the two arrays are equal. It displays an error notice and quits if their lengths are different.
2. Iterating across both arrays, it modifies

## Task 3: Creating Objects from Arrays

This task involves creating an array of objects from two separate arrays: one containing names and another containing ages. The `people` array is created by mapping over the `names` array and creating an object for each name with the corresponding age from the `ages` array.

## Task 4: Creating a README File

This task involves creating a `README.md` file that explains the purpose and functionality of the previous tasks.
